# 🌱 RootAccess

RootAccess is a **web-based mapping tool** that visualizes **spatial disparities in access to child care services** across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), with a particular focus on immigrant families.  
This interactive app is designed to support **equity-driven urban planning** by highlighting geographic inequalities in child care accessibility.

> 🔧 **Work in Progress** — This is an early-stage prototype. Features, data, and design will continue to evolve.
